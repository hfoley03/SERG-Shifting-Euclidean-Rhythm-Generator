# SERG: Shifting Euclidean Rhythm Generator

SERG is a music composition tool inspired by Steve Reichs concept of phase shifting rhythms.

## Introduction

### What are Phase Shifting Rhythms

Phase Shifting Rhythms is the name we have given to a technique that Steve Reich used across his discography.

To explain the concept we will take his piece “Clapping Music for Two Performers” as an example:
* The piece starts with both performers clapping a 1 bar rhythm in unison, repeated 12 times.
* On bar 13 the 1st player continues the rhythm as normal. However, the 2nd player claps a rhythm that is the original rhythm circular shifted by one pulse. Again this is repeated for 12 bars.
* This process of circular shifting is repeated until the 2nd player's rhythm has been shifted back to it's original position.

This simple principle is amazing at producing some very unique feeling rhythmic pieces as the two rhythms go in and out of phase. There is a push-pull effect felt as syncopation is intermittently introduced.
It is this concept of shifting a rhythm over time that our project is based on.

### SERG's Design

SERG has two sets of phase shifting rhythms that are played in sync.

Set 1 consisting of Track 1 and Track 2, and Set 2 consisting of Track 3 and Track 4.

The base rhythm for each set is generated by a euclidean rhythm.

Blah blah blah
