??? What's the plan ???

Notes:
  I think we should build our code to allow a max of 3 or 4 players
  Any more than that and the sound will probably be too busy and messy code
  Build it with 3 or 4 in mind but initially implement two players

  Appears there will always be 120 ticks in 1/16th note


Definitions:
  Rhythm - the 1 bar beat generated by the Euclidian module
  Step/tatum - the subdivision of our rhythm
  Pulse - a hit/note in a rhythm
  Phase Shift Amount - by how many steps is the rhythm shifted by
  Phase Period - after how many bars is a rhythm shifted

Code Modules/Elements Needed
  1. Euclidian Rhythm Generator
  2. Phase Shifter & Composition Structure
  3. In Browser Playback
  4. Convert to Midi and export
  5. GUI

Extra
  Visualisation of Rhythtm
  Melodic Mode:
    Scales
    Melody Rules
  Effects:
    Reverb
    Delay



// Euclidian Rhythm Generator //

This 'module' of our code is in charge with generating the starting rhythm for our composition.

Information on Euclidian Rhythms can be found in this book sent to Harry by Sarti:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v2edNBUB_pIx2j3HOd3-7OWsdyI0wB2e/view?usp=share_link

Starting Constraints:
  Rhythm will be 1 bar long
  Written in 4/4 timing and in 16th notes
  This means a rhythm generated will have 16 steps
  We are calling the notes that are played/hit in our rhythm pulses

Input Parameters:
  Number of pulses
  Number of steps (initially hardcoded to 16)

Output:
  The module will output the rhythm in the json midi format specified by tone.js

Notes:
  set velocity of pulse 1 to 1 and the following pulses to 0.7

////////////////////////////////////////////

// Phase Shifter & Composition Structure //

This 'module' will be incharge of the overall composition of our piece
It will build a larger json midi structure from the one bar rhythm created by the Euclidian Rhythm Generator
Each 'player' should be added to the same midi structure as an individual track

Input Parameters:
  Number of players / tracks of midi (initially hardcoded to 2)
  Phase Shift Amount - by how many steps is the rhythm shifted by
  Phase Period - after how many bars is a rhythm shifted
  Length of Composition - how many bars should the overall piece be

OutPut:
  Complete Json Midi of the composition


////////////////////////////////////////////

// In Browser Playback //

Responsible for how our midi is played back in our web application, the global controls.
It would be nice to be able to set the synth or sample for each midi track/player.
For example, track one is a synth with these specific parameters,
and track two is a synth with another set of specific parameters.

Parameters:
  bpm
  selection of sound for each player
  Play/Pause
  Reset
